Hi! I am a M.Sc. Informatics student at Technical university of Munich specializing in computer vision, deep learning and machine learning. I recently started my master thesis at TUM [Visual computing group](http://www.niessnerlab.org/index.html) headed by [Prof.Dr.Mathiass Niessner](http://www.niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html). Previously, I have completed a research project with the same chair on the topic "Human model learning from RGB with depth assistance". I have also worked on other interesting projects, do check them out in the projects section.

Also, I am currently working as CUDA Developer(Student) at Forschungs-Neutronenquelle Heinz Maier-Leibnitz. Previously, I worked as an AI/Computer Vision research work student at Osram GmbH, where I built computer vision and machine learning algorithmns for drive monitoring systems.
